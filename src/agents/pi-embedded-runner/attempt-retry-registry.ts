/**
 * Magister fork: runId-keyed coordination between the embedded run loop's
 * retries (run.ts) and per-attempt terminal lifecycle emission
 * (pi-embedded-subscribe.handlers.lifecycle.ts).
 *
 * The run loop's `while (true)` reuses one runId across every attempt, but the
 * SDK fires `agent end` per attempt — so a retried attempt's terminal lifecycle
 * event is not terminal for the run. Emitting it anyway makes stream
 * subscribers (openai-http.ts chat completions, agent.wait waiters) finalize
 * while the run keeps working; the retried turn then completes headless and its
 * output never reaches the subscriber.
 *
 * That has now happened twice. The June 2026 orphaned webchat kickoff incident
 * was the context-overflow retry, and this registry was written for it. On
 * 2026-08-07 the same thing happened on the empty-response retry: GPT-5.6
 * returned no visible text, the run loop retried and produced the real answer
 * 13s later, and the user saw "Agent didn't return a response" because the
 * stream had already been closed by attempt 1's `phase: "end"`. The first fix
 * only covered `phase: "error"` — the four non-error retry paths went through
 * an unguarded emission — which is why this is named for retries in general
 * rather than for overflow.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - run.ts arms budget predicates at run start (armAttemptRetryRecovery) and
 *   disarms in its finally (disarmAttemptRetryRecovery).
 * - handleAgentEnd asks before emitting a terminal event:
 *   shouldSuppressTerminalOverflowError() for the error branch,
 *   withholdTerminalForPendingRetry() for the ordinary `end` branch.
 * - run.ts clears both records when a retry attempt actually starts
 *   (noteRetryAttemptStarted) — the new attempt owns the terminal now.
 * - On any give-up path run.ts emits the withheld terminal itself exactly once,
 *   via consumeSuppressedTerminal() (error) or consumeWithheldTerminal() (end).
 *
 * The two halves differ in what they can know, which is why they are separate
 * calls rather than one. Overflow is visible *during* an attempt — it is an API
 * error — so its predicate is a pure budget check. Whether the loop will retry
 * a no-visible-answer attempt is decided *after* the attempt resolves, which is
 * strictly later than `agent end`. So the `end` branch withholds on "budget
 * remains and this attempt produced nothing visible" and relies on the run
 * loop's finally to flush what it withheld. Over-withholding is safe (the event
 * is emitted microseconds later, still inside the run); under-withholding is
 * the bug.
