/**
 * Brokered repository checkout, and what can be done with one (Phases 3.1–3.2).
 *
 * The checkout is the primitive: freezing a commit and pushing a branch both
 * operate on a tree this module put on disk and cannot exist without it, which
 * is why all three live here.
 *
 * The Gateway resolves the project's GitHub or GitLab grant and posts it here;
 * this host process runs `git` with the credential reachable only through `GIT_ASKPASS`
 * plus the child's own environment. The credential never appears in argv, in a
 * remote URL, in Git config, in a response body, or anywhere the sandbox can
 * read: the model-directed shell runs `--clearenv --unshare-net --unshare-pid`
 * as a different user, so it can neither inherit the variable nor read this
 * process's `/proc` entry. Freezing a commit is purely local, so that request
 * carries no credential at all.
 *
 * Checkouts live at `/data/repos`, a volume sibling *outside* `OPENCLAW_HOME`.
 * Every recursive walk on a machine — the backup checkpointer, the boot-time
 * workspace chmod, and the restore validator — is rooted at `/data/.openclaw`
 * or narrower, so a sibling is excluded from all of them by construction rather
 * than by six exclusion lists that a seventh walk would silently miss. See
 * `docs/plans/2026-08-24-phase-3-1-checkout-limits-lock.md` in the monorepo.
